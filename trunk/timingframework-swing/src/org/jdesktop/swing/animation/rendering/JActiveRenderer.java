/**
 * Manages two-thread active rendering on a Swing {@link JRendererPanel}.
 * <p>
 * To use this renderer a client constructs a {@link JRendererPanel} and passes
 * it to the constructor with a flag indicating if the passed component will
 * have children that need to be rendered and a {@link JRendererTarget}
 * implementation. A typical sequence would be
 * 
 * <pre>
 * JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;Renderer Demonstration&quot;);
 * final JRendererPanel on = new JRendererPanel();
 * frame.setContentPane(on);
 * JRenderer renderer = new ActiveRenderer(on, true, this);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * In the above snippet <tt>on</tt> will be rendered to. Swing children will be
 * added to <tt>on</tt> by the client code (indicated by passing <tt>true</tt>
 * as the second argument) and should be shown. The enclosing instance,
 * <tt>this</tt>, implements {@link JRendererTarget} and will be called to
 * customize what is displayed on-screen.
 * <p>
 * The {@link JRendererTarget} implementation is called according to the
 * following protocol.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link JRendererTarget#renderSetup(Object)} is called once when
 * <tt>on</tt> is made visible. It allows the client to perform any necessary
 * setup.</li>
 * <li>{@link JRendererTarget#renderUpdate()} is called at the start of each
 * rendering cycle to allow the client to update its state prior to rendering.</li>
 * <li>{@link JRendererTarget#render(Object, int, int)} is called after
 * <tt>renderUpdate()</tt> during each rendering cycle to allow the client to
 * control what is displayed on-screen.</li>
 * <li>{@link JRendererTarget#renderShutdown()} is called once after
 * {@link JActiveRenderer#shutdown()} to allow the implementation to perform any
 * necessary cleanup.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The <i>rendering cycle</i> occurs as fast as the hardware can support. So
 * <tt>renderUpdate()</tt> and <tt>render()</tt> will be called many times per
 * second.
 * <p>
 * There are two threads involved in active rendering: (1) a rendering thread
 * and (2) the Swing Event Dispatch Thread (EDT). When the passed
 * {@link JComponent} is made visible this is detected in the EDT and two tasks
 * are submitted to be executed in the rendering thread: (1) The
 * {@link JRendererTarget#renderSetup(Object)} method is called to let the
 * client perform its setup. (2) The rendering loop is started.
 * <p>
 * The rendering thread runs the following sequence as fast as it can:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A call is made to {@link JRendererTarget#renderUpdate()} to allow the
 * client to update its state.</li>
 * <li>Internally, {@link CountDownLatch#await()} is called on the latch that is
 * waiting for the EDT thread to finish painting (skipped during the first
 * iteration).</li>
 * <li>A call is made to {@link JRendererTarget#render(Object, int, int)} to
 * allow the client to render onto an off-screen image.</li>
 * <li>A call to {@link SwingUtilities#invokeLater(Runnable)} asks the EDT
 * thread to paint the off-screen image on the screen.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The EDT thread, in addition to its normal Swing processing, performs the
 * following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Paints the off-screen image to the screen.</li>
 * <li>Invokes {@link CountDownLatch#countDown()} to "pass" the off-screen image
 * back to the animator thread.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This two-thread active rendering approach has several advantages. First, it
 * <b>never</b> blocks the EDT. Second, it allows the
 * {@link JRendererTarget#renderUpdate()} to execute concurrently with painting
 * to the screen. Third, while the render thread can block, this only occurs if
 * painting to the screen takes longer than invoking
 * {@link JRendererTarget#renderUpdate()}.
 * <p>
 * The implementation depends upon the safe sharing of the {@link BufferedImage}
 * used as the off-screen image between the rendering thread and the EDT. The
 * use of {@link SwingUtilities#invokeLater(Runnable)} safely "passes" the image
 * from the rendering thread to the EDT and the use of the
 * {@link CountDownLatch} safely "passes" from the EDT back to the rendering
 * thread.
 * <p>
 * Clients can execute code in the rendering thread by calling
 * {@link #invokeLater(Runnable)} (in a manner similar to
 * {@link SwingUtilities#invokeLater(Runnable)}). This call is essential to
 * safely notify the rendering thread about events that occur in the EDT or
 * other program threads.
 * <p>
 * Several statistics are tracked which can be queried to understand active
 * rendering performance.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getFPS()} provides "frames per second" or how many times per
 * second the screen is painted. This is the best measure of overall performance
 * and is often displayed on-screen.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getAverageCycleTimeNanos()} provides how many nanoseconds, on
 * average, it tools to execute one complete rendering cycle.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getAveragePaintTimeNanos()} provides how many nanoseconds, on
 * average, it took the EDT to paint the off-screen image to the screen.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getAverageRenderTimeNanos()} provides how many nanoseconds, on
 * average, it took the rendering thread to render to the off-screen image (by
 * calling {@link JRendererTarget#render(Object, int, int)}).</li>
 * <li>{@link #getAveragePaintWaitTimeNanos()} provides how many nanoseconds, on
 * average, the rendering thread "blocked" waiting for the EDT to finish
 * painting to the screen. Because the rendering thread invokes
 * {@link JRendererTarget#renderUpdate()} before it has to "block" and wait for
 * the EDT to finish painting, this time can be significantly smaller than
 * {@link #getAveragePaintTimeNanos()}. <i>If this time is not smaller than
 * {@link #getAveragePaintTimeNanos()} then this two-thread active rendering
 * approach should probably not be used, i.e., a simple loop in a single thread
 * will be more efficient (i.e., provide more FPS).</i></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Adding Swing components as children of <tt>on</tt> is supported. Ensure that
 * <tt>true</tt> is passed as the third argument to
 * {@link #JActiveRenderer(JRendererPanel, JRendererTarget, boolean)}. The
 * children are drawn in the EDT and never accessed in the rendering thread.
 * <p>
 * Use of the Timing Framework is supported via a {@link ManualTimingSource}
 * that can be obtained via {@link #getTimingSource()}. This timing source is
 * "ticked" once per rendering cycle. Client code should consider setting the
 * timing source as the default for animations, similar to the snippet below.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * AnimatorBuilder.setDefaultTimingSource(renderer.getTimingSource());
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Then the timing source's <tt>tick()</tt> method is invoked within the
 * rendering thread just prior to the call to <tt>renderUpdate()</tt>.
