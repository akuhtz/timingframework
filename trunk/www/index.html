        <h1>Timing is Everything</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the TimingFramework project. This project contains source code for 
            the articles <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/02/15/timing.html">Timing 
                is Everything</a> and <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2006/03/16/time-again.html">Time Again</a> on java.net.
        </p>
        <P>The project has been updated significantly since the original article. The new 
            features implemented are described more completely in the "Time Again" article, 
            but briefly they include:
            <ul>
                <li>
                Property Setters: Easy delegation of property animation to the framework (like 
                changing the size of a component over time, for example).
                <li>
                KeyFrames: More powerful and complex animations via multi-step sequences of 
                time/value pairs.
                <li>
                Non-Linear Interpolation: More interesting and useful animations by specifying 
                spline paths for value interpolation.
                <li>
                Acceleration/deceleration: Easy specification of simple non-linear behavior by 
                telling the TimingController periods of acceleration and deceleration during 
                the normal time fraction.
                <li>
                    Minor upgrades: Various additions to the existing classes, such as the ability 
                    to call <code>TimingController.addTarget()</code> to add additional 
                    TimingTargets to the same TimingController; this should make it easier to 
                    synchronize several timers together. Check out the ButtonAnimation demo to see 
                    how this is done for both the button animation and the fraction display label.</li></ul>
        <P></P>
        <p>There are also some new demos here. The old "SimpleAnimation" demo has gone away 
            and has been replaced by the "ButtonAnimation" demo. This new demo is along the 
            same lines as the previous one: it's a basic and&nbsp;unattractive front-end 
            that exposes the dials and knobs of the timing framework through the GUI, 
            allowing you to tweak the parameters and see the results. Between the graphical 
            view of what's happening and the code for this demo, this will hopefully make 
            it easier to understand the various features of the framework.
        </p>
        <p>There is also a great demo by Romain Guy written to both show off and educate 
            about the new KeySplines/non-linear interpolation capabilities of the library. 
            There is no source for this one right now, but this one is more for showing 
            what splines can do, not necessarily for how to reuse the code to do those 
            animations.
        </p>
        <p>The project is also NetBeans-friendly, so you should be able to download the 
            project and build it easily. I'm running in NetBeans 5.0, in case you need that 
            version to interpret the&nbsp;project files correctly.
        </p>
        <p>The main things to check out here are the Articles, the <A href="https://timingframework.dev.java.net/source/browse/timingframework/src">
                source code</A>, the <A href="javadoc/allclasses-frame.html">Javadocs for the timing framework</A>, 
            the <A href="TimingFramework.jar">library</A>, and the demos (source for 
            ButtonAnimation is in the <A href="https://timingframework.dev.java.net/source/browse/timingframework/demo">
                demo directory</A>, compiled versions of the demos are in the 
            TimingFramework jarfile). Note that the library is dependent upon jdk 5.0, so 
            you will need 5.0 to run it or build against it.
        </p>
        <p>To run the demos, download <A href="TimingFramework.jar">TimingFramework.jar</A>. 
            Then you can run one of the two demos as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ButtonAnimation: This is the simple demo that exposes the various dials and 
                    knobs of the Timing Framework library. This demo should run automatically if 
                    you run TimingFramework.jar, or you can run it explicitly by typing:
                    <pre>        java -cp TimingFramework.jar org.jdesktop.animation.timing.examples.ButtonAnimation</pre>
                <li>
                    SplineEditor: This is the demo for showing how splines control animation 
                    timing. You can run this by typing:
                    <pre>        java -cp TimingFramework.jar org.jdesktop.animation.timing.examples.editor.SplineEditor
</pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <P></P>
        <p>The project is still read-only for now; this is because the project is still 
            very much in flux, but it's also because I want to make sure that any 
            interesting developments in the project can be pulled into Java SE if 
            appropriate; after all, if there are useful timing utilities that people need, 
            why not put them into core where they belong? I hope to change that eventually 
            (probably by using a JCA license like SwingLabs does), but for now feel free to 
            browse, download, and build the source, or to just use the library as you see 
            fit. I'm thinking that's all that most people want for now anyway...
        </p>
        <p>
            For those folks that got here by reading the original Timing is Everything 
            article, I've cached a zipped version of the original source code in <A href="articleSrc.zip">
                articleSrc.zip</A>, although I'd just suggest reading the second article 
            and using the current source instead; lots of things in the latest library to 
            make life with Timing Framework much easier than with the original version.
        </p>
        <P>
            Check back for future changes. I think the latest round of changes is quite 
            powerful and will enable some great animations in Swing applications, but 
            there's more work to be done...</P>
        <p>
            <i>I would like to thank Christopher Campbell, Hans Muller, Scott Violet, Romain 
                Guy, and Vincent Hardy for contributing to ideas and code in both the article 
                and project. This article and project took a while to incubate and the 
                assistance of these people hopefully made the end result better than it 
                otherwise would have been.</i>
