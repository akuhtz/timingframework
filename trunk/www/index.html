        <h1>Timing is Everything</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the TimingFramework project. This project contains source code for 
            the "Timing is Everything" article, published <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/02/15/timing.html">
                here</a>.
        </p>
        <P></P>
        <p>
            The main things to check out here are the <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/02/15/timing.html">
                Article</a>, the <a href="https://timingframework.dev.java.net/source/browse/timingframework/src">
                source code</a>, the <a href="doc/allclasses-noframe.html">Javadocs for the 
                timing framework</a>, and the <a href="http://timingframework.dev.java.net/SimpleAnimation.jar">
                SimpleAnimation sample application</a>. Note that SimpleAnimation was 
            compiled with J2SE 5.0, so the jar file will only work for you if you have 5.0 
            installed. (You can download the sources and recompile under a different jdk if 
            you prefer).
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to download and build the project (please do!), grab the 
            appropriate files and either run "ant" in the main directory (where build.xml 
            resides) or load it into NetBeans 4 (note the handy-dandy NetBeans project file 
            in the "nbproject" directory).
        </p>
        <P>This project is starting to take on a life post-article, so I'm doing a couple 
            of things to change the way things work here:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                One is that there is a zipped-up version of the original source code, <A href="articleSrc.zip">
                    articleSrc.zip</A>, available for download if you are looking for the 
                source that exactly matches the original article.</LI>
            <LI>
                Another major change coming soon is that I will soon open the gates to allow 
                other people to start making changes here.&nbsp; I have not done that to date 
                because the real intent of the project was to simply live as a source 
                repository for the article.&nbsp; But also, I wanted to make sure that any 
                interesting developments in this timing project could be pulled into j2se if 
                necessary; after all, if there are useful timing utilities that people need, 
                why not put them into core where they belong?&nbsp; I posted the project 
                originally before working on the details of how that could work.&nbsp; Now I 
                understand how that works (basically, people that want to submit code into the 
                project will need to sign a JCA license that gives us the right to reuse the 
                code here in the jdk).&nbsp; I'll be changing the site soon to make that 
                mechanism possible.&nbsp; <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> this does <EM>not</EM> mean 
                that everyone that wants to check out and use the code needs to sign this 
                license; this only applies to people that want to putback changes to this 
                project.</LI></UL>
        <P>In the meantime, I've just put back changes to the project to start improving 
            the code.&nbsp; This first step is that I've introduced a new interface, 
            TimingTarget, and a new way to send timing events.&nbsp; In the original 
            version, TimingController had to be subclassed and timing events were sent to 
            the timingEvent() method of the subclass.&nbsp; Now, the event is sent either 
            to the subclass or, if TimingController is not subclassed, is sent to the 
            TimingTarget object that the non-subclassed controller ws constructed 
            with.&nbsp; I think this change will make it easier to use TimingController, 
            certainly in situations where a single object wants to receive timing events 
            from multiple controllers.&nbsp; I also made minor modifications to 
            SimpleAnimation to reflect the TimingTarget change as well as an unrelated 
            change to optimize the area being updated on every frame.</P>
        <P>Check back for future changes; I hope to keep the project going on a trajectory 
            layed out vaguely in the article.&nbsp; The first step is to have value 
            interpolations.&nbsp; Then we'll continue on, probably aiming toward general 
            SMIL support in the long term.</P>
        <p>
            I would like to thank Christopher Campbell, Hans Muller, Scott Violet, and 
            Vincent Hardy for contributing to ideas and code in both the article and 
            project. This article and project took a while to incubate and the assistance 
            of these people hopefully made the end result better than it otherwise would 
            have been.
