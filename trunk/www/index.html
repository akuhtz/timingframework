	<h1>Timing is Everything</h1>
	<p>
	    Welcome to the TimingFramework project. This project contains source code for 
	    the "Timing is Everything" article, published 
	    <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/02/15/timing.html">here</a>.
	    </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	    The main things to check out here are the <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/02/15/timing.html">
		Article</a>, the <a href="https://timingframework.dev.java.net/source/browse/timingframework/src">
		source code</a>, the <a href="doc/allclasses-noframe.html">Javadocs for the 
		timing framework</a>, and the <a href="http://timingframework.dev.java.net/SimpleAnimation.jar">
		SimpleAnimation sample application</a>. Note that SimpleAnimation was 
	    compield with J2SE 5.0, so the jar file will only work for you if you have 5.0 
	    installed. (You can download the sources and recompile under a different jdk if 
	    you prefer).
	</p>
	<p>
	    If you want to download and build the project (please do!), grab the 
	    appropriate files and either run "ant" in the main directory (where build.xml 
	    resides) or load it into NetBeans 4 (note the handy-dandy NetBeans project file 
	    in the "nbproject" directory).
	</p>
	<p>
	    I would like to thank Christopher Campbell, Hans Muller, Scott Violet,
	    and Vincent Hardy for contributing to ideas and code in both the
	    article and project.  This article and project took a while to
	    incubate and the assistance of these people hopefully made the
	    end result better than it otherwise would have been.
	</p>
