/**
 * The abstract base class of all triggers. It contains two public methods,
 * {@link #disarm()} which can be used to disable a trigger and
 * {@link #isArmed()} which checks if a trigger is armed.
 * <p>
 * This abstract class should be overridden by any class wanting to implement a
 * new trigger. The subclass will define the events to trigger off of and any
 * listeners to handle those events. The subclass will call
 * {@link #fire(TriggerEvent)} to start, or trigger, the animation based on an
 * event that occurred.
 * <p>
 * The trigger may be setup to auto-reverse the animation. This reverses the
 * running animation when the opposite event to the trigger event occurs. The
 * opposite event is obtained by invoking
 * {@link TriggerEvent#getOppositeEvent()} on the trigger event. If the
 * animation is not running and the opposite event occurs the animation is
 * started in reverse.
