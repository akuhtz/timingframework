/**
 * This class controls the timing of animations. Instances are constructed by a
 * {@link Animator.Builder} instance by invoking various set methods control the
 * parameters under which the desired animation is run. The parameters of this
 * class use the concepts of a "cycle" (the base animation) and an "envelope"
 * that controls how the cycle is started, ended, and repeated.
 * <p>
 * For example, this animation will run for 1 second, calling your
 * {@link TimingTarget}, {@code myTarget}, with timing events when the animation
 * is started, running, and stopped:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Animator.setDefaultTimingSource(source); // shared timing source
 * 
 * Animator animator = new Animator.Builder().setDuration(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS).addTarget(myTarget).build();
 * animator.start();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The following variation will run a half-second animation 4 times, reversing
 * direction each time:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Animator animator = new Animator.Builder().setDuration(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).setRepeatCount(4).addTarget(myTarget).build();
 * animator.start();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * More complex animations can be created through the use of the complete set of
 * properties in {@link Animator.Builder}.
 * <p>
 * This class provides a useful "debug" name via
 * {@link Builder#setDebugName(String)} and {@link #getDebugName()}. The debug
 * name is also output by {@link #toString()}. This feature is intended to aid
 * debugging.
 * <p>
 * Instances can be started again after they complete, however, ensure that they
 * are not running, via <tt>!</tt>{@link #isRunning()} or {@link #await()},
 * before {@link #start()} or {@link #startReverse()} is called. Even if you
 * successfully invoked {@link #stop()} or {@link #cancel()} it can take some
 * time for all the calls to registered {@link TimingTarget}s to complete. Use
 * of {@link #await()} is far more efficient than polling the state of the
 * animation with {@link #isRunning()}. However, do not call {@link #await()} in
 * the thread context of the timing source for this animation or it will block
 * forever.
 * <p>
 * This class is thread-safe. Synchronizing on the instance(<tt>this</tt>) may
 * be used to protect state changes over several calls.
