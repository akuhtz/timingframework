/**
 * This class interpolates fractional values to animate movement in "discrete"
 * steps. A discrete animation is defined to be one where the values during an
 * animation do not change smoothly between the boundary values, but suddenly,
 * at the boundary points. For example, a discrete animation with KeyFrames
 * where the KeyTimes are {0, .5, 1.0} and the KeyValues are (0, 1, 2} would,
 * during the animation, retain the value of 0 until half-way through the
 * animation and 1 through the rest of the animation.
 * <p>
 * Because this class has no state, it is implemented as a singleton that is
 * referenced using the {@link #getInstance} static method. The singleton
 * instance is thread-safe.
