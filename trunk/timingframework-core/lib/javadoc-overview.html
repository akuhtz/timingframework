<p>The Timing Framework is a set of utility classes that enables you to create
powerful animations in your Java applications.</p>

<p>The Timing Framework was implemented by Chet Haase and introduced in the book
<i>Filthy Rich Clients</i> (Haase and Guy, Addison-Wesley, 2008).</p>

<p>Improvements to Haase's release were implemented by Tim Halloran beginning
in 2011. These improvements include</p>

<ul>
<li>A separation of generic Java code from Swing-specific code.
This allows the Timing Framework to be useful for a wide-variety of graphical
interface libraries. Two are currently supported: Swing and
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">SWT</a>. The original
implementation was, in places, quite Swing-specific. Generic Java code is placed in
packages under <tt>org.jdesktop.core</tt> and released (stand-alone) as the
<tt>timingframework-core</tt> distribution at
<a href="http://java.net/projects/timingframework/">java.net</a>.</li>

<li>Improved support for the AWT/Swing graphical interface library.
Swing-specific code is placed in packages under <tt>org.jdesktop.swing</tt>
and released (combined with the core code) as the <tt>timingframework-swing</tt>
distribution at <a href="http://java.net/projects/timingframework/">java.net</a>.</li>

<li>Support for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">SWT</a> graphical interface
library. A competitor to Swing that is used by the popular
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> platform. SWT-specific code is placed in
packages under <tt>org.jdesktop.swt</tt> and released (combined with the core code) as
the <tt>timingframework-swt</tt> distribution at
<a href="http://java.net/projects/timingframework/">java.net</a>.</li>

<li>Use of the builder pattern to construct animations. This avoids the mix of passing some
parameters to an <tt>Animator</tt> constructor and some to "set" methods. For example,
The following animation will run a five second animation four times on <tt>myTarget</tt>:
<pre>
Animator animator = new AnimatorBuilder().setDuration(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                                         .setRepeatCount(4)
                                         .addTarget(myTarget)
                                         .build();
animator.start();
</pre>
</li> 

<li>The ability to support a single timing source as advocated by Chet Haase
in the JavaOne 2008 talk <i>Filty Rich Clients: Filthier Richer Clientier</i>.
This is done by setting a default timing source on the <tt>AnimatorBuilder</tt>
class. For example, the following snippet of code creates a Swing timer and sets
it as the default for all animations.
<pre>
TimingSource source = new SwingTimerTimingSource(15, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
AnimatorBuilder.setDefaultTimingSource(source); // shared timing source
source.init(); // starts the timer
...
source.dispose(); // stops the timer
</pre>
</li>

<li>A multi-thread safe implementation that takes advantage of the
<tt>util.concurrent</tt> library.</li>
</ul>
