<p>The Timing Framework is a set of utility classes that enables you to create
powerful animations in your Java applications.</p>

<p>The Timing Framework was implemented by Chet Haase and introduced in the book
<i>Filthy Rich Clients</i> (Haase and Guy, Addison-Wesley, 2008).</p>

<p>Improvements to Haase's release were implemented by Tim Halloran beginning
in 2011. These improvements include</p>

<ul>
<li>A separation of generic Java code from Swing-specific code.
This allows the Timing Framework to be useful for a wide-variety of graphical
interface libraries. Two are currently supported: Swing and
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">SWT</a>. The original
implementation was, in places, quite Swing-specific. Generic Java code is placed in
packages under <tt>org.jdesktop.core</tt> and released (stand-alone) as the
<tt>timingframework-core</tt> distribution at
<a href="http://java.net/projects/timingframework/">java.net</a>.</li>

<li>Improved support for the AWT/Swing graphical interface library.
Swing-specific code is placed in packages under <tt>org.jdesktop.swing</tt>
and released (combined with the core code) as the <tt>timingframework-swing</tt>
distribution at <a href="http://java.net/projects/timingframework/">java.net</a>.</li>

<li>Support for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">SWT</a> graphical interface
library. A competitor to Swing that is used by the popular
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> platform. SWT-specific code is placed in
packages under <tt>org.jdesktop.swt</tt> and released (combined with the core code) as
the <tt>timingframework-swt</tt> distribution at
<a href="http://java.net/projects/timingframework/">java.net</a>.</li>

<li>Use of the builder pattern to construct animations. This avoids the mix of passing some
parameters to an <tt>Animator</tt> constructor and some to "set" methods. For example,
The following animation will run a five second animation four times on <tt>myTarget</tt>:
<pre>
Animator animator = new AnimatorBuilder().setDuration(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                                         .setRepeatCount(4)
                                         .addTarget(myTarget)
                                         .build();
animator.start();
</pre>
</li> 

<li>The ability to support a single timing source as advocated by Chet Haase
in the JavaOne 2008 talk <i>Filthy Rich Clients: Filthier Richer Clientier</i>.
This is done by setting a default timing source on the <tt>AnimatorBuilder</tt>
class. For example, the following snippet of code creates a Swing timer and sets
it as the default for all animations.
<pre>
TimingSource source = new SwingTimerTimingSource(15, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
AnimatorBuilder.setDefaultTimingSource(source); // shared timing source
source.init(); // starts the timer
...
// create, use, and dispose lots of Animator instances
...
source.dispose(); // stops the timer
</pre>
</li>

<li>A multi-thread safe implementation that takes advantage of the
<tt>util.concurrent</tt> library.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Swing and SWT releases contain several demonstration programs that can be run from the
release Jar file or built from source code. Many of these demonstration programs are updated
versions of the programs presented in <i>Filthy Rich Clients</i> and they are organized by
chapter, e.g., <tt>ch14</tt> for Chapter 14. Each demonstration is described in the book
and within its source code.

<p>The Swing demonstrations are:

<ul>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swing.animation.timing.demos.ch12.TimingSourceResolution</tt></li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swing.animation.timing.demos.ch14.FadingButtonTF</tt></li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swing.animation.timing.demos.ch14.BasicRace</tt></li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swing.animation.timing.demos.ch14.NonLinearRace</tt></li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swing.animation.timing.demos.ch14.SplineInterpolatorTest</tt></li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swing.animation.timing.demos.ch15.Triggers</tt></li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swing.animation.timing.demos.ch15.ClickAndGo</tt> (not in the book&mdash;demonstrates non-trivial property setters)</li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swing.animation.timing.demos.ch15.DiscreteInterpolation</tt> (console)</li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swing.animation.timing.demos.ch15.MultiStepRace</tt></li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swing.animation.timing.demos.javaone2008.TooManyBallsBroken</tt> (illustrates the Swing timer issues Chet Haase discussed at JavaOne 2008)</li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swing.animation.timing.demos.javaone2008.TooManyBalls</tt> (fixed version&mdash;this demonstration is the Jar's <tt>Main-Class</tt>)</li>
</ul>

<p>To run one of the demonstrations from the release Jar file use:

<p><tt>java -cp timingframework-swing-2.0.jar <i>classname</i></tt>

<p>The Swing <tt>TooManyBalls</tt> demonstration can be changed from passive rendering to game-like active
rendering (see the <tt>JActiveRenderer</tt> class) by defining the <tt>org.jdesktop.renderer.active</tt> property. For example, use:

<p><tt>java -cp timingframework-swing-2.0.jar -Dorg.jdesktop.renderer.active=true org.jdesktop.swing.animation.timing.demos.javaone2008.TooManyBalls</tt>

<p>On some computers active rendering looks smoother, but has the cost of using two processors and lots of memory. It is perhaps
more appropriate for a game than a desktop application. It is, however, straightforward to write programs that can change from passive
to active rendering, like <tt>TooManyBalls</tt> does, by implementing <tt>JRendererTarget</tt>.

<p>The Swing distribution also includes <tt>org.jdesktop.swing.animation.timing.splineeditor.SplineEditor</tt>
(from Chapter 14) which can be used to design and preview a particular spline interpolation.

<p>The SWT demonstrations are:

<ul>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swt.animation.timing.demos.ch12.TimingSourceResolution</tt></li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swt.animation.timing.demos.ch14.FadingButtonTF</tt> (fades the background not the button because SWT doesn't support transparent components)</li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swt.animation.timing.demos.ch14.BasicRace</tt></li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swt.animation.timing.demos.ch14.NonLinearRace</tt></li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swt.animation.timing.demos.ch14.SplineInterpolatorTest</tt></li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swt.animation.timing.demos.ch15.Triggers</tt></li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swt.animation.timing.demos.ch15.ClickAndGo</tt> (not in the book&mdash;demonstrates non-trivial property setters)</li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swt.animation.timing.demos.ch15.DiscreteInterpolation</tt> (console)</li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swt.animation.timing.demos.ch15.MultiStepRace</tt></li>
<li><tt>org.jdesktop.swt.animation.timing.demos.javaone2008.TooManyBalls</tt> (SWT version&mdash;this demonstration is the Jar's <tt>Main-Class</tt>)</li>
</ul>

<p>To run one of the SWT demonstrations from the release Jar file use:

<p><tt>java -cp "timingframework-swt-2.0.jar;swt.jar" <i>classname</i></tt>

<p>In the example above I copied the <tt>swt.jar</tt> for my platform into the
same directory, but you can reference it within another directory (the command above
worked on Windows under Cygwin).

<p>Neither the spline editor nor active rendering are currently implemented under SWT.</p>
