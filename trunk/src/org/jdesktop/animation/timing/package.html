Core classes of the Timing Framework; these classes provide the
base functionality that all timers will use.
<p>
This package provides the fundamental capabilities of the Timing
Framework, including the Cycle and Envelope that timing is
based upon as well as the TimingTarget and TimingListener
interfaces that applications will implement to receive
events.  TimingController is the main class that is responsible
for setting up and running animations.
